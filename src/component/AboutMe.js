            Hello, I am a dude that codes things, I started out as your standard retail worker and decided I needed more in my career life. I started learning code while working full time about 5 years ago, starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I fell in love with creating things from nothing and working with logic. Ever since I have been doing my best to code every day and learning something new a day. I am currently looking for a career working with code.
